<h3><li>Database Normalization</li></h3>
<p>

Database normalization is a technique of organizing the data into multiple related tables with the purpose of minimizing DATA REDUNDANCY.<br>

<strong> Advantages of data normalization: </strong><br>
1) Improving overall database organization (inserting/updating/deleting data will be much easier)<br>
2) Data consistency<br>
3) Reducing redundancy<br>
4) Reducing data storage/process cost<br>
5) Making it easier to deal with larger amounts of data (sorting, searching and creating indexes is much faster since tables are narrower and more rows fit on a data page)<br>


<strong> Types of data normalization: </strong><br>
1) 1st normal form<br>
The first normal form focus is on designing scalable tables that can be easily extended. The first normal form has the following 4 rules:<br>
<ul>
- A single cell/attribute must not hold more than one value (atomicity)<br>
- Values stored in a column should be of the same data type.<br>
- Each column name in a table should have a unique name.<br>
- The order in which data is stored in a table should not matter.<br>
</ul>
2) 2nd normal form<br>
3) 3rd normal form<br>
4) BCNF<br>
