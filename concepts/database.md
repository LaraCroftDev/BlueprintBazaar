<h3><li>Database Normalization</li></h3>
<p>
Database normalization is a technique of organizing the data into multiple related tables with the purpose of minimizing DATA REDUNDANCY.<br>
<strong> Advantages of data normalization: </strong><br>
1) Improving overall database organization (inserting/updating/deleting data will be much easier)<br>
2) Data consistency<br>
3) Reducing redundancy<br>
4) Reducing data storage/process cost<br>
5) Making it easier to deal with larger amounts of data (sorting, searching and creating indexes is much faster since tables are narrower and more rows fit on a data page)<br>
<strong> Advantages of data normalization: </strong><br>

<strong> Types of data normalization: </strong><br>
1) 1st normal form
2) 2nd normal form
3) 3rd normal form
4) BCNF
